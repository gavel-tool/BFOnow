# BFOnow
Should be called BFnOw

Contains two ontology files:
- bfo-fowl is a version of BFO 2.0 OWL where a cotemporal version of FOL annotations from BFO 2.0 CLIF and some RO object properties have been added
- bfo-fowl-annotations-only contains only the FOL annotations and object properties, not the BFO classes
